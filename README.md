# CQMacroCreator

CQMacroCreator is a "GUI' for Dicecycle's Cosmos Quest PvE Instance Solver https://github.com/Diceycle/C-Hero-Calc

Just place CQMacroCreator.exe in the same folder as CosmosQuest.exe and run it. I suggest saving your hero file with different name than default "heroLevels2.7.2" as it is automatically updated every time you run a calc.
