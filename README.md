# CQMacroCreator

CQMacroCreator is a "GUI' for Dicecycle's Cosmos Quest PvE Instance Solver https://github.com/Diceycle/C-Hero-Calc

Just place CQMacroCreator.exe in the same folder as CosmosQuest.exe and run it. I suggest saving your hero file with different name than default "heroLevels2.7.2" as it is automatically updated every time you run a calc.

# What's new

Hero save files now keep which heroes were enabled.
Added check/uncheck all button and "Select best heroes" button. The latter one selects up to 12 heroes with highest strength.
Added short guide and few tooltips.
